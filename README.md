# Techfest-26
An aesthetic “Coming Soon” landing page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the TechFest of Government Engineering College, Buxar. It features a bold full-screen title, college name visibility, a placeholder logo, and a modern tech vibe inspired by events like Robo Race, Robo Soccer, Robo Dangal, and other robotics-based competitions.
